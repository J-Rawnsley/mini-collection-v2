# Joe's Mini Collection

## About

This Mini-collection is not intended to be a portfolio, or to demonstrate a professional standard of work. The landing page and the items it links to are not finished products... yet. Instead, this collection is intended to document my learning journey and act as a focal point and a place for me to experiment, which may eventually evolve into something more polished. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions - joe.rawnsley@gmail.com
