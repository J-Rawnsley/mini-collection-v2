        I'm Joe Rawnsley, a self-taught software developer based in Manchester, UK. This collection of work is a place for me to share the personal projects that document my learning journey and act as a focal point to test and share my work. The projects were built with JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. The front-end-only apps have been deployed on Netlify, making use of Netlify's serverless functions. The two full-stack apps are deployed on Railway. Contact me at joe.rawnsley@gmail.com to report any bugs or ask any questions.
